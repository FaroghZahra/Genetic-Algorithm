# Genetic-Algorithm
Solving 8 Queens problem using genetic algorithm.
A genetic algorithm is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm inspired by "Darwin's theory of evolution in Nature." 
This is practical implementation of genetic algorithm for solution of 8- Queens Problem. The implentation uses both cross-over and mutation techniques.
